To solve the issue, ensure that the parent element has its dimensions explicitly defined. This can be done by setting `width` or `max-width` to a specific value, or by using viewport units (like `vw` or `vh`). For instance, you might set the container to `width: 100vw;` to guarantee that the percentage calculation has a defined basis.  This ensures that `calc(100% - 10px)` works reliably.
